// 2. maintain cart data in the state; it goes without saying; you are expected to use useReducer as state management tool; ( Hint : different actions you are expected to have are adding item to cart, removing item from cart, and checkout ..)

// 3. send both state and dispatch values so that entire application has access to the state and dispatch function;
