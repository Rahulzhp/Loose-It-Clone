// 2. maintain loading,error, auth status and token in the state; it goes without saying; you are expected to use useReducer as state management tool; (hint : different actions that you are expected to have can be login - loading, success, failure ..)

// 3. send both state and dispatch values so that entire application has access to the state and dispatch function;
